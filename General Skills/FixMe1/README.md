# FixMe1.py - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: FixMe1.py
Points: 100
Category: General Skills

## Objective
The objective of the FixMe1.py challenge is to learn the basics of Python and overcome issues in Python code to uncover the hidden flag.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these methods:

**Method 1: Direct Hex Decoding**
1. **Examine the Python code**: Start by examining the provided Python code. You will immediately notice the flag encoded in hexadecimal.

2. **Decode the flag**: You can directly decode the hexadecimal flag to reveal the actual flag

3. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you discover during the challenge.

**Method 2: Fixing Code Indentation**
1. **Run the Python program**: You can also run the Python program. However, when attempting to run it, you may encounter errors. Python relies on proper indentations to separate different "blocks" of code.

2. **Identify indentation issue**: The final line of the code likely has an incorrect or inconsistent indentation, causing the Python interpreter to throw errors.

3. **Fix the indentation**: Correct the indentation issue in the Python code. This typically involves ensuring consistent use of spaces or tabs for indentation. Once fixed, the Python interpreter will no longer produce errors.

4. **Flag revealed without decoding**: When you run the Python program after fixing the indentation, the flag will be printed without the need for manual decoding.

5. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you discover during the challenge.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Enjoy learning Python and solving code issues, and happy hacking!
