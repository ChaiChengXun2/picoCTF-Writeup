# Codebook - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Codebook
Points: 100
Category: General Skills

## Objective
The objective of the Codebook challenge is to learn the basics of Python programming. Your task is to uncover the hidden flag within a provided Python script.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Download and run the Python file**: Start by downloading and running the provided Python script. The script contains the logic necessary to reveal the flag.

2. Execute the Python script using a Python interpreter or an appropriate Python environment.

3. When you run the script, it will perform its operations and eventually reveal the flag.

4. The flag format is `SKR{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you discover when you execute the Python script.

5. Alternatively, you can manually decode the hex-encoded flag, but running the Python program is likely faster and more convenient as it automates the decoding for you.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Enjoy your exploration of Python and uncovering the flag, and happy hacking!
