# Bases - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Bases
Points: 100
Category: General Skills

## Objective
The objective of the Bases challenge is to become familiar with base64 encoding and decoding. Your task is to decode a given base64-encoded message and discover the hidden flag.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Examine the encoded message**: You are provided with a base64-encoded message. Base64 encoding is a common technique for representing binary data in an ASCII string format.

2. **Decode the base64 message**: If you are familiar with the pattern of base64 encoding, you can proceed to decode the message directly. Base64 typically uses a fixed set of characters, including letters, digits, and a few special characters.

3. If you are not confident in your knowledge of base64, and not able to recognise that it is base64, you can use tools like CyberChef's "magic" tool, which can automatically detect and decode various encodings.

4. After decoding the base64 message, the flag will be revealed.

5. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you discover when you decode the base64 message.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Enjoy your exploration of base64 encoding and decoding, and happy hacking!
