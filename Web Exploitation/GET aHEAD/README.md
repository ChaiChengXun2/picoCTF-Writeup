# CTF Challenge Writeup
**Name:** GET aHEAD
**Points:** 20
**Category:** Web Exploitation

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to modify a standard HTTP GET request to a HEAD request using Burp Suite and understand the purpose of a HEAD request in web exploitation.

## Solution

1. **Understanding HTTP Requests**
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests are fundamental to web communication. A GET request is commonly used to retrieve data from a web server. In this challenge, your objective is to transform a GET request into a HEAD request.

2. **Using Burp Suite**
   - Burp Suite is a popular web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool. It allows you to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. To modify the GET request, you need to use Burp Suite.

3. **Changing GET to HEAD Request**
   - With Burp Suite, capture the GET request sent to the target server. You can use Burp's proxy functionality to intercept the request.

4. **Understanding the HEAD Request**
   - A HEAD request is a standard HTTP request method used to retrieve only the headers of a resource on the server. It's similar to a GET request but doesn't retrieve the actual content of the resource, making it useful for checking the resource's metadata, such as its size or last modification date.

5. **Executing the Challenge**
   - Modify the captured GET request to a HEAD request. This transformation is a key step in the challenge.

6. **Request Execution**
   - After changing the request method to HEAD, send the modified request using Burp Suite.

7. **Flag Retrieval**
   - The server's response to the HEAD request will contain the flag you're seeking. Extract the flag from the response.

## Flag
The flag for the GET aHEAD challenge is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`. Replace 'XXXXXXXXXX' with the actual flag you obtain from the server's response after successfully transforming the GET request to a HEAD request using Burp Suite.

Congratulations on completing this Web Exploitation challenge! You've learned how to manipulate HTTP requests and understand the purpose of a HEAD request in web exploitation.
