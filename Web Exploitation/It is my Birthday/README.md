## Solving
The objective of this challenge is to understand the concept of collisions in the MD5 hashing algorithm.

**Step 1: Collision in MD5**
- In cryptography, a collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. For the MD5 hashing algorithm, it is known that collisions can be found due to its vulnerabilities.

**Step 2: Finding Collisions**
- For this challenge, you can find examples of MD5 collisions in the form of PDF documents. One source to find such examples is the GitHub repository at [corkami/collisions](https://github.com/corkami/collisions).
- Download two different PDF files from the repository that showcase MD5 collisions.

**Step 3: Submitting Collisions**
- Once you have the two PDF files with MD5 collisions, submit both of them to the instance provided by picoCTF to complete the challenge.
