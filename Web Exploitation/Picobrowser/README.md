# Picobrowser - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Picobrowser
Points: 200
Category: Web Exploitation

## Objective
The objective of the Picobrowser challenge is to learn how to modify the headers of a GET request to gain access to a web page.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Access the provided instance**: When you access the instance provided for this challenge, you will notice that the page displays an error message, informing you that you are using an invalid browser.

2. **Change the browser**: Your goal is to modify the headers of the GET request to make the page believe you are using a valid browser. Not by downloading it, of course, picobrowser does not exist. 

3. **Use Burp Suite**: Burp Suite is a powerful tool for web application testing and manipulation. You will use it to modify the headers of the GET request.

4. **Steps to use Burp Suite**:
   - Open Burp Suite and navigate to the Proxy tab.
   - Turn on the Intercept option. This will allow you to intercept and modify the traffic between your browser and the target web page.
   - Open the Burp Suite's built-in browser.
   - Paste the link to the challenge into the Burp Suite browser.
   
5. **Intercepted request**: Once the link is provided and you click "Go," you will notice that the page hangs. This is because the request is intercepted by Burp Suite.

6. **Modify the User-Agent header**: In Burp Suite, find the User-Agent field in the request header. Modify this field to include the value "picobrowser."

7. Forward the modified request in Burp Suite.

8. The web page will now accept your request, and you will be able to access it.

9. The flag will be displayed on the web page. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you need to discover.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Happy header manipulation and happy hacking!
