# Forbidden Path - Web Exploitation Challenge

## Basic Information
**Name:** Forbidden Path  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 200

## Objective

The "Forbidden Path" challenge in the Web Exploitation category aims to test my understanding of directory traversal and the ability to access restricted directories to find the flag.

## Solution

This is how I approached and solved the "Forbidden Path" web exploitation challenge:

1. **Challenge Description:**
   - The challenge informed me that the flag was located four directories above the current directory. My task was to figure out how to navigate to this directory.

2. **Using Directory Traversal:**
   - To traverse to the desired location, I needed to use "../" to navigate up one directory level.
   - I repeated the "../" four times to ascend four directory levels. This got me to the root directory.

3. **Accessing the Flag:**
   - Once I was at the root directory, I needed to continue by appending "../../../../" to access the parent directories.
   - After doing this four times, I had successfully moved four directories above my current location.

4. **Printing the Flag:**
   - Finally, I used the path "../../../../flag.txt" to access and print the flag file.

Flag: picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}

**Challenge Solved**
