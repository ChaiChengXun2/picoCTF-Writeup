# Local Authority - Web Exploitation Challenge

## Basic Information
**Name:** Local Authority  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 100

## Objective

The "Local Authority" web exploitation challenge aimed to test my web security skills by identifying vulnerabilities in a web application and extracting the flag.

## Solution

This is how I approached and solved the "Local Authority" web exploitation challenge:

1. **Visit the Website:**
   - I started by visiting the website provided in the challenge. Upon initial inspection, it appeared to be a simple web page with no visible elements, such as JavaScript files or PHP scripts.

2. **Suspicion of SQL Injection:**
   - Given the category of the challenge, I initially suspected it might involve a SQL injection attack. I tested the website by submitting a basic SQL payload, but surprisingly, the website didn't respond as expected. Instead, it returned an error message, indicating an "illegal instruction."

3. **Discovery of Secure.js:**
   - While investigating further, I noticed that after the "illegal instruction" error, the website dynamically loaded a JavaScript file named "secure.js."

4. **Inspecting secure.js:**
   - I decided to inspect the content of "secure.js" to see if it contained any information or potential vulnerabilities. Upon examining the script, I found something interesting - plaintext credentials.

5. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   - The credentials I discovered in "secure.js" allowed me to log in to the web application. Once authenticated, I had access to the flag, which I retrieved to complete the challenge.

Flag: picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}
