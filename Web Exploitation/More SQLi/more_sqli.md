## Solving  

The "More SQLi" challenge centres around the concept of SQL injection (SQLi). It presents an opportunity to hone your skills in exploiting SQL vulnerabilities.  

Upon first inspection, the challenge provides hints that suggest the need for trying various SQL injection techniques. As a starting point, I referred to a comprehensive SQL injection payload list available at [SQL injection payload list](https://github.com/payloadbox/sql-injection-payload-list) to gather potential payloads.  

Admittedly, I wasn't well-versed in SQL injection techniques, so I embarked on a journey of trial and error. I systematically tested several payloads to discern any vulnerabilities in the web application's input handling.  

After a series of attempts, I finally discovered an injection payload that yielded results. This breakthrough was achieved through a combination of experimentation and reasoning, unravelling the underlying SQL injection vulnerability.  

SQL Injection that worked for me:   
```' OR 1 -- -```   

```
SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = ' ' OR 1 -- - ' AND username = '  ' OR 1 -- - '
```   

Essentially, SQL treats anything after the first sets of ```-- -``` as comments, and I was able to get into their database.  

The cleverly hidden flag was embedded within the POST request of the web application. To unveil it, I employed the powerful interception capabilities of Burp Suite. Intercepting and analysing the HTTP requests allowed me to pinpoint the location of the flag within the response.  

Flag: picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_c8ee9477}  

With this successfully extracted flag, the challenge was triumphantly completed.
