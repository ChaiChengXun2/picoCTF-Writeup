# Scavenger Hunt - CTF Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Name**: Scavenger Hunt
- **Points**: 50
- **Category**: Web Exploitation

## Objective
The objective of the "Scavenger Hunt" CTF challenge is to hone your web exploitation skills by navigating through different web resources to find pieces of a hidden flag. Each part of the flag is hidden in different web assets, and your task is to locate and assemble them. This challenge aims to teach participants the importance of examining various web elements, including HTML, CSS, robots.txt, and server configuration files.

## Solution
To successfully complete the "Scavenger Hunt" challenge, I followed these steps:

1. **HTML Page Inspection**:
   - I began by inspecting the HTML page source to identify the first part of the flag.
   - I looked for any hidden comments or embedded information within the HTML.

3. **JavaScript Files Investigation**:
   - Next, I examined the JavaScript files, but found nothing relevant to the flag.
   - Not all web elements contain parts of the flag, so it's essential to move on when necessary.

4. **Exploring robots.txt**:
   - I proceeded to explore the 'robots.txt' file on the server, which contained the third part of the flag.
   - The robots.txt file often provides information about what should be hidden from web crawlers.

5. **Utilizing .htaccess**:
   - The 'robots.txt' file mentioned something related to Apache servers, which piqued my interest.
   - I tried accessing the '.htaccess' file and found the fourth part of the flag.
   - .htaccess files are used to configure Apache web servers and may contain sensitive information.

6. **Searching for Hidden Files**:
   - The final part of the flag was related to the Mac store.
   - I tried accessing the '.DS_Store' file and found the last piece of the flag.
   - .DS_Store files are used by macOS to store directory metadata.
