# Includes - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Includes
Points: 100
Category: Web Exploitation

## Objective
The objective of the Includes challenge is to learn about the basics of inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a web application. Your goal is to uncover the hidden flag by examining the source code and files used by the web page.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **View page source**: Start by using the "View Page Source" feature in your web browser. This is one of the most effective techniques for inspecting a web page and its underlying code.

2. **Inspect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: As you view the page source, carefully inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code used by the web application. Look for any clues or fragments of the flag.

3. You may find that fragments of the flag are intentionally scattered across different parts of the code, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

4. **Reconstruct the flag**: Collect the flag fragments you discover and reconstruct the complete flag.

5. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you uncover during your inspection of the web page source code.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Enjoy your exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within web applications, and happy hacking!
