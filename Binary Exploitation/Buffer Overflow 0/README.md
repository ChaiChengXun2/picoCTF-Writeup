# Buffer Overflow 0 - Binary Exploitation Challenge

## Challenge Overview
**Name:** Buffer Overflow 0  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation  
**Points:** 100

## Objective

The objective of the "Buffer Overflow 0" challenge is to exploit a simple buffer overflow vulnerability in a provided binary program. The goal is to trigger a segmentation fault by overflowing the buffer, which will lead to the execution of a specific function that prints the flag.

## Solution Steps

To complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Source Code:**
   - Begin by examining the provided source code for the binary program.
   - Take a close look at the `sigsegv_handler` function, which is invoked when a segmentation fault occurs.

2. **Overflow the Buffer:**
   - Execute the binary with an input that overflows the buffer.
   - The goal is to provide more input than the buffer can handle, causing it to overflow and trigger a segmentation fault.

3. **Capture the Flag:**
   - When the buffer overflows and a segmentation fault occurs, the `sigsegv_handler` function will be called, and it will print the flag, revealing the challenge's solution.
