# Basic File Exploit - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Basic File Exploit
Points: 100
Category: Binary Exploitation

## Objective
The objective of the Basic File Exploit challenge is to learn about C programming and exploit a vulnerability in a provided C program.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Given the C program source code**: You will be provided with the source code of a C program. Your task is to carefully analyze this code to identify any vulnerabilities.

2. **Look through the code**: Examine the C code closely, focusing on how it handles input and data manipulation.

3. **Identify the vulnerability**: In the provided C code, the vulnerability is located on line 143 with the following code snippet:
   ```c
   ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0)
   ```
   - `strtol` is a function that converts a string into a long integer.
   - The code checks if the result of this conversion is equal to 0.
   - The issue here is that when a string is passed to strtol that cannot be converted directly into a long integer, it will return 0. For example, if ```"10"``` is passed to strtol the output would be ```10```, but if a string is supplied, it will return ```0``` because the conversion failed. 

4. **Exploit the vulnerability**: Basically, any string passed into the `data_read()` function will trigger the vulnerability. It will then reveal the flag.  

5. As you exploit the vulnerability, you will eventually find the flag. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you need to discover.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Happy coding and happy hacking!
