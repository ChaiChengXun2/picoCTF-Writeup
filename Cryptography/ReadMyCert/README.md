## Basic Information
- **Category**: Cryptography
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Points**: 100

## Solving
The objective of this challenge is to understand Certificate Signing Request (CSR) encoding.

**Step 1: Understand CSR**
- A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is typically used in public key infrastructure (PKI) to request a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). A CSR contains information about the entity requesting the certificate, such as the public key, common name, and other details.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Challenge**
- In this challenge, you are presented with a CSR encoded string.

**Step 3: Decoding the CSR**
- To solve this challenge, you need to decode the provided CSR to extract the relevant information.
- You can use online CSR decoder websites or tools designed for decoding and examining CSR files.

**Step 4: Retrieve the Flag**
- Decode the CSR to reveal its contents, including any embedded flag.
- Copy the flag to complete the challenge.

**SOLVED**
Flag: picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}

By successfully decoding the CSR, you demonstrate your understanding of CSR encoding and your ability to extract the hidden flag.
