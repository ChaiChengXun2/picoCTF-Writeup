## Basic Information
Category: Cryptography  
Difficulty: Easy  
Points: 100  

## Solving
The objective of this challenge is to learn and apply a ROT cipher.

**Step 1:**  
You are provided with an encrypted text.

**Step 2:**   
The text has been encrypted using a ROT cipher, but the specific rotation offset (key) is unknown.

**Step 3:**   
To decrypt the text, you can use an online tool that performs brute force decryption of ROT ciphers.

One such tool is available at [https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher).

**Step 4:**   
Using the online tool, input the encrypted text and let it brute force the decryption by trying all possible rotation offsets.

**Step 5:**   
Check the output for the deciphered text.

**Step 6:**   
Submit the flag to complete the challenge.
