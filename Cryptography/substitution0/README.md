# substitution0 - Cryptography Challenge

## Basic Information
- **Name:** substitution0
- **Category:** Cryptography
- **Points:** 100

## Objective
The "substitution0" challenge introduces participants to substitution ciphers. In this challenge, you are presented with a ciphertext that has been encrypted using a substitution cipher. Your objective is to decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the hidden message.

## Solution
To successfully complete the "substitution0" challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Examine the Ciphertext:**
   - Begin by carefully examining the provided ciphertext. It consists of letters, numbers, or symbols that have been encrypted using a substitution cipher.

2. **Decipher the Substitution Cipher:**
   - Substitution ciphers involve replacing each letter in the plaintext with another letter, number, or symbol according to a fixed pattern or key.
   - While you can write scripts to automate the decryption process, for simplicity, you can use online tools like [Quipquip](https://www.quipqiup.com/).
   - Quipquip is a reliable substitution cipher decoder that can quickly decipher messages encrypted using various substitution methods.

3. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   - Once you have successfully decrypted the ciphertext, you will reveal the hidden message.
   - The decrypted message is the flag for this challenge.

This challenge helps you practice decrypting messages encoded with substitution ciphers, which are fundamental in cryptography.

## Flag
Congratulations! You have successfully solved the "substitution0" cryptography challenge by decrypting the substitution cipher.
