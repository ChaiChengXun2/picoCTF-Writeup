# morse-code - Cryptography Challenge

## Basic Information
- **Name:** morse-code
- **Category:** Cryptography
- **Points:** 100

## Objective
The "morse-code" challenge aims to teach participants how to decipher Morse code. In this challenge, you are presented with an audio file containing Morse code signals. Your objective is to decode the Morse code to reveal the hidden message.

## Solution
To successfully complete the "morse-code" challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Audio:**
   - Start by examining the provided audio file. You can use software like Audacity for audio analysis.

2. **Decipher Morse Code:**
   - Listen to the audio and identify the Morse code signals. Morse code consists of dots (.) and dashes (-) representing letters and numbers.
   - To help you decode the Morse code, you can use online Morse code decoders like [Morse Code Decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).
   - If you are not familiar with Morse code, online tools can assist in translating the audio signals into text.

3. **Manually Correct Morse Code:**
   - In some cases, online tools may not perfectly translate Morse code, or they may miss some characters.
   - Use Audacity or similar audio editing software to manually adjust the Morse code signals, if needed. Add any missing characters or underscores (_) as required to complete the Morse code message.

4. **Decode and Retrieve the Flag:**
   - Once you have successfully decoded the Morse code message, you will reveal the hidden text.
   - The decoded message is the flag for this challenge.

This challenge helps you practice your Morse code decoding skills and demonstrates how Morse code is used in cryptography to convey hidden messages.

## Flag
Congratulations! You have successfully solved the "morse-code" cryptography challenge by deciphering the Morse code audio.
