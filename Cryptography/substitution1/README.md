# substitution1 - Cryptography Challenge

## Basic Information
- **Name:** substitution1
- **Category:** Cryptography
- **Points:** 100

## Objective
The "substitution1" challenge continues to explore substitution ciphers. In this challenge, you are presented with a ciphertext encrypted using a substitution cipher. Your objective is to decrypt the ciphertext and unveil the hidden message.

## Solution
To successfully complete the "substitution1" challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Ciphertext:**
   - Start by carefully examining the provided ciphertext. It consists of letters, numbers, or symbols that have been encrypted using a substitution cipher.

2. **Decrypt the Substitution Cipher:**
   - Substitution ciphers involve replacing each letter in the plaintext with another letter, number, or symbol based on a fixed pattern or key.
   - While you can create scripts to automate the decryption process, you can opt for the easy route by utilizing online tools like [Quipquip](https://www.quipqiup.com/).
   - Quipquip is a dependable substitution cipher decoder that can rapidly decipher messages encrypted using various substitution techniques.

3. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   - Input the ciphertext into Quipquip or a similar tool.

By completing this challenge, you gain experience in deciphering messages encoded using substitution ciphers, furthering your understanding of this cryptographic technique.

## Flag
Congratulations! You have successfully conquered the "substitution1" cryptography challenge by decrypting the substitution cipher.
