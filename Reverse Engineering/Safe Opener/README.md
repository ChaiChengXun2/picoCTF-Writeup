# Safe Opener - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Safe Opener
Points: 100
Category: Reverse Engineering

## Objective
The objective of the Safe Opener challenge is to learn about Java programming and reverse engineering. You will need to analyze a Java code file to discover a hidden password.

## Solution
To successfully complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Java file**: Using any text editor, open the provided Java file.

2. **Read the Java code**: Examine the Java code within the file. The code contains a hidden password that is encoded using Base64.

3. **Locate the Base64-encoded password**: Within the Java code, search for the Base64-encoded string that represents the password.

4. **Decode the Base64**: Once you find the Base64-encoded password, decode it using a Base64 decoding tool or by writing a simple script in Java or any other suitable language. The decoded string will reveal the password.

5. Use the discovered password to complete the challenge.

6. The flag format is `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is the actual flag you need to discover.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `picoCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Happy Java exploration and reverse engineering, and happy hacking!
