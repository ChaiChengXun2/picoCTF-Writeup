# picoCTF-Writeup
Welcome to my repository of picoCTF writeups! Here, you'll find solutions to a variety of challenges across different domains, including Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Forensics, General Skills, Binary Exploitation, and Uncategorised.

Through the challenges, I try my best to use KALI Linux tools to solve problems instead of relying on online tools to complete them.
